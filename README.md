# MiDaS-PyTorch

> MiDaS models for computing relative depth from a single image.
In this repository, I share my exploration of the MIDAS (Multiple Instance Detection and Segmentation) model implemented using PyTorch. MIDAS is a powerful framework for object detection and segmentation in scenarios where objects appear in clusters, making it ideal for various applications like counting objects in densely populated scenes.
